# Vim Configuration

This configuration includes several custom keybindings for Vim/Neovim.

## Keybindings

- `Ctrl+k`: Move the current line up.
- `Ctrl+j`: Move the current line down.
- `J`: Jump to the next empty line.
- `K`: Jump to the previous empty line.
- `y` in visual mode: Yank (copy) the selected text to the system clipboard.

## Disabled Arrow Keys

Arrow keys are disabled in normal, insert, and visual modes to encourage the use of Vim's h, j, k, l navigation.

## Installation

Add the contents of `vim_config.vim` to your `.vimrc` or `init.vim` file.
